<p>I am a sophmore working towards a computer science degree with a certificate in cybersecurity.<br> 
To deal with the stress of school I have a cat at home that I love very much. Her name is shadow.<br>

One of my favorite games to play in-between classes is the <a href="https://trex-runner.com/">offline T-Rex game</a>.<br>
Some of my favorite videos to put on in the background while I'm working on homework are the old pink panthers. 
Here is a video of pink panther that I would put on while working.<br>
